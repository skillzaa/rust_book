# What is rust-book project about
-   This is an mdBook project.
-   Using mdBook library I have converted my notes into a static website.
-   This website is hosted on [https://skillzaa.github.io/rust_book/](https://skillzaa.github.io/rust_book/). 
- The main project is placed in dropbox for safe custody incase the laptop goes out of order.
- Keep in mind that the project is deployed on git hub using two repositories. 
    -   The [https://github.com/skillzaa/rust_book](https://github.com/skillzaa/rust_book) repository just hosts its book part. The book part is hosted on here and not the complete project.
