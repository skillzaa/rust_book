In the Name of Allah Most Merciful.   

I have started this new project to write about Rust Programming language. 
Hopefully I will continue this project for a very long time.  
These are my notes which I created while learning and coding Rust language. 
# Rust Useful Code Snippets

In the following pages I am going to write some useful Rust code snippets that I have used during my programming.

Every now and then we come acress a problem while programming that takes hours of our time. We spend hours and then either never use this knowledge or forget about it completely.
The following pages are an attempt to have small code snippets, each one explaining a point such that they can be used for learning as well as later reference.
